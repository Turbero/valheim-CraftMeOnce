# Craft Me Once

Craft Me Once is a client mod that will let you know which recipes you have not crafted yet with an exclamation mark in the workstations.
This way you will be able to discover recipes that are made of other recipes easily.

(Note: This is compatible even with mods that can paginate workstation lists, like AAACrafting)

## Usage instructions

Open any workstation, then check the recipes list. They will have a yellow "!" in the list if you haven't crafted yet at least once.

Enable/disable the mod or show debug logs by modifying the .cfg file while inside the game, you don't need to close the game.
