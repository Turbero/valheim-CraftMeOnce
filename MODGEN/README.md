# Craft Me Once

Craft Me Once is a client-mod that will let you know which recipes you have not crafted yet with an exclamation mark in the workstations. 
This way you will be able to discover recipes that are made of other recipes more easily

## Usage instructions

Open your workstations at your ward, then check the recipes list. They will have a yellow "!" if you haven't crafted yet at least once.
